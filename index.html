        <p>After a cataclysmic explosion rips through Sol and nearby systems, the Galactic Empire is rapidly decaying. Corruption and piracy run rampant. But where there is chaos, there is also opportunity.</p>
        <p>Seize that opportunity for yourself in this freeform space trading and mercenary game: buy newer and stronger ships, hire pilots to grow your fleet, or help a faction achieve its goals. Get credits to use toward your goal by delivering cargo, hunting bounties, ferrying passengers, or even turning to piracy. The choice is yours. Along the way, you will help decide the future of the galaxy.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the eye of the Imperial storm.â€¦</p>

        <h3>About Naikari</h3>

        <p>A lightless void. That is what most of space is. Yet in spite of this, humankind has long looked up at the night sky in wonder, wishing to bask in the light of the tiny specks tucked throughout the sea of darkness.</p>
        <p>After a cataclysmic explosion rips through Sol and nearby systems, the Galactic Empire is rapidly decaying. Corruption and piracy run rampant. But where there is chaos, there is also opportunity.</p>
        <p>Seize that opportunity for yourself in this freeform space-trading and mercenary game: buy newer and stronger ships, hire pilots to grow your fleet, or help a faction achieve its goals. Get credits to use toward your goal by delivering cargo, hunting bounties, ferrying passengers, or even turning to piracy. The choice is yours. Along the way, you will help decide the future of the galaxy.</p>
        <p>Welcome to the eye of the Imperial storm.â€¦</p>

        <h3>About Naikari</h3>
        <p>Naikari is a 2-D space trading and mercenary sandbox game, similar to games like Endless Sky, but with a heavier emphesis on survival and combat.</p>
        <p>You pilot space ships from a top-down perspective which you can collect and customize more or less however you want. To get new ships, you can deliver cargo, hunt bounties, join and assist various factions, or even turn to piracy if you dare go against the Empire. Additionally, to keep the game feeling fresh and allow you to seek out goals beyond just getting more credits and ships, several storylines are available which you can proceed through if you wish. All storylines are optional and kept out of the way if you have no interest in them.</p>
